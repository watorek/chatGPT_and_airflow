App Name: Fiserv PbP Account Balance Reconciliation

Description:
This application is responsible for automating the reconciliation of account balances 
between the Fiserv system and the PbP system. The app performs the following tasks:

1. Connects to the 'WHEELER' database environment specified by the 'ENVIRONMENT' variable.
2. Fetches account balance data using pre-defined SQL queries for:
    - Matching balances between Fiserv and PbP
    - Mismatches in balances between the two systems
3. Creates dataframes from the fetched data.
4. Checks the dataframes for any records. If records are found:
    - The type (matches or mismatches) and the number of records are stored.
    - Data is exported to an Excel file, which is saved with a timestamped filename.
5. Depending on the reconciliation results (all matched, all mismatched, or a mix of both),
   an appropriate email is drafted. The email content is generated dynamically, including a subject 
   line, main message, and sometimes an attached dad joke or an emoji for added context.
6. The email is sent to a pre-defined list of recipients with an option to attach the exported Excel files.
